            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <hr class='short-line'><br>
            <p>Welcome to Shape Marketing! We're your consultants — Shea and Katrina. Running a business is no easy task, and sometimes
            it's hard to know where to begin — we get it! Your social media is a great place to start, and we're here to help you
            promote your business the way you imagined when you decided to give life to your passion!
            </p>
            <hr class='double-line'>
            <p>However you came across our business — we're so grateful that you did! Wherever you're at in your entrepreneurial
            journey, we'd like to welcome you to the Shape family and introduce ourselves! We're Shea and Katrina, digital marketing
            consultants extraordinaire and the co-founders of Shape Marketing. Our agency is a platform created to help you dig to
            the root of your vision, find your voice and shape your brand through digital solutions unique to your business!</p>
            <br>
            <p>To help you get to know us better, let's take a quick look back at when we first met. We were both completing a
            marketing degree at NAIT and Shea sat in front of Kat in an 8 a.m. Sales Management course — yup, just two students
            living off Starbuck’s lattes and three hours of sleep! We connected right away and because we had similar values when it
            came to marketing, we quickly became each others go-to project partner.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We never really intended to start a business. But hey, if we've learned anything from working with our clients over the
            last couple of years, it's that the best and most intriguing ideas are usually unintentional. We both knew that there
            was a more personal aspect missing in the style of marketing most businesses have adopted, and we wanted help our
            clients fill that gap. The goal? To engulf ourselves in the businesses we partner with to fully understand the story and
            the purpose behind their offerings when creating content. To not let that purpose get lost behind an advertisement, and
            to be their "go-to" project partner just like we were, and have been for each other ever since.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, with just our laptops, our Starbucks, and our determination in hand we launched Shape Marketing! We’re so excited to
            connect with you, and to help you promote your vision as you become a part of ours!</p>
